<p>Sometimes you need to persist console information between page loads. Sometimes we need this for reference or perhaps to view any logs that occur on click or unload.</p>

<p class="chrome">In Chrome, right click in the console to reveal a menu with "Preserve Log upon Navigation" as an option. Selecting this will keep your console content.</p>

<p class="firefox">Firefox will persist console content by default. You can clear the console log by clicking the 'clear' button in the top right or opening and closing the tools.</p>

<p class="firebug">In Firebug, thereâ€™s an obvious button for persisting console content directly above the console.</p>

<p class="opera">Opera will persist console content by default. You can clear the console log by right clicking and selecting "Clear console" or by opening and closing the tools.</p>
