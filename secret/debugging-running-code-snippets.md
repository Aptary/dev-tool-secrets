<p class="chrome">If you find yourself running the same code time and time again, Chrome Canary provides a handy 'Snippets' area where you can store code to run from the console.</p>
<p>To find 'Snippets', navigate to the 'Source' tab and it will be next to 'Sources' and 'Content Sources'. Right click in the empty area to find the option to create a new snippet, write your code and then whenever you need to run it, right click and select 'Run'.</p>
