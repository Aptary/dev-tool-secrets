<p class="chrome">If you use Geolocation in your application, it may be useful to simulate being in a different location. Chrome allows you to do this by going to the "Settings" menu and selecting the "Overrides" tab. Within this tab it is possible to simulate a different latitude and longitude, and it is possible to simulate a geolocation being unavailable.</p>

<p>You can obtain the longitude and latitude of a location from Google Maps by enabling the LatLng tooltip on the <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?showlabs=1" target="_blank">Google Maps Labs page</a>.</p>
