<p class="chrome">In Chrome, when your Javascript execution is paused during a breakpoint, you can interact with and inspect all variables and objects in the current scope, either by hovering over to inspect or by using the console.</p>

<p class="chrome">This powerful feature enables you to easily inspect variables inside closures if you set your breakpoint appropriately.</p>
