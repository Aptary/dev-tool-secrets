<p class="firefox">Firefox comes with a built in font inspector, that allows you to see the fonts used on the element you are currently inspecting.</p>

<div class="firefox image"><img src="assets/img/placeholder.gif" data-src="/assets/img/secrets/firefox-inspect-fonts.gif" /></div>

<p class="firefox">You can modify the default "Abc" text to try the font with any text you would like. At the bottom of the fonts list is a button to display all fonts on the page, allowing an easy way to see exactly what fonts are being used on the page.</p>
