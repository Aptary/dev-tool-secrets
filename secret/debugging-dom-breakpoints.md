<p class="chrome firebug">If you know your page is breaking when a certain part of the DOM changes, or you just want to find out what script is responsible for changing an elements attributes or children, Chrome and Firebug both allow you to set a breakpoint on DOM modification allowing you to find the culprit in your code. Simply highlight the element you want to monitor and right click to select the conditions to break on.</p>
