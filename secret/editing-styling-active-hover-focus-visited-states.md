<p>Styling CSS in the Developer Tools is great, but becomes a little more tricky when testing other element states such as hover. Thankfully, there is a solution.</p>

<p class="chrome">Chrome has a button built for this purpose. In the “Elements” tab’s right hand column look for the dotted element/cursor icon which allows you to try other states.</p>

<p class="firebug">For Firebug, in the right hand column click the arrow menu beside the Style tab and selected your desired state.</p>

<p class="firefox">Firefox provides a small drop down next to the DOM element selected when it is clicked in "inspect" mode. Alternatively, you can right click on the element in the DOM.</p>

<p class="opera">In Opera, it’s the icon that looks like a list under “Styles”.</p>
