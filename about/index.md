## Welcome ##

Welcome to "Secrets of the Browser Developer Tools"! Over the last few years there has been one tool that has helped out every web developer more than any other – the browser developer tools. Working in harmony with the web browser, the developer tools allow us to manipulate DOM elements; gauge performance and debug JavaScript from within the browser window in real time.

There are many features hidden away in the browser development tools and this site aims to help you find them. We're not expecting every one of these to be unknown to you, but hopefully some of these will help you to become an even better web developer. We will not just be showing you in Chrome (as so many articles do) - we need our sites to work in every browser, so whereever it's possible we'll give you the instructions on how to use each browser. Each browser has its own web developer tools with its own capabilities, and we aim to cover that here.

I don't know them all myself, so if you have more to share, why not <a href="/contribute/">contribute</a>?

Happy Developing!

## What are Developer Tools? ##

Nowadays it seems hard to imagine ever building a website without one of these handy tools, which are normally accessible by either pressing "F12" in Windows or "Cmd" ⌘, "Option" ⌥ and "I" on the Mac, or by right clicking on the page and selecting “Inspect Element”.

## The Ideal Developer Tool Environment? ##

Historically developers have used Firefox's Firebug add-on to develop and debug their websites, but in recent years Chrome's Developer Tools have pulled away from the others offering superior tools.
