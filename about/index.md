# About #

## Welcome ##

Welcome to "Secrets of the Browser Developer Tools"! Over the last few years there has been one tool that has helped out every web developer more than any other – the browser developer tools. Working in harmony with the web browser, the developer tools allow us to manipulate DOM elements; gauge performance and debug JavaScript from within the browser window in real time.

Happy Developing!

## What are Developer Tools? ##

Nowadays it seems hard to imagine ever building a website without one of these handy tools, which are normally accessible by either pressing "F12" in Windows or "Cmd" ⌘, "Option" ⌥ and "I" on the Mac, or by right clicking on the page and selecting “Inspect Element”.

## The Ideal Developer Tool Environment? ##

Historically developers have used Firefox's Firebug add-on to develop and debug their websites, but in recent years Chrome's Developer Tools have pulled away from the others offering superior functionality.
